### Scratchpad
- Anne Boylen story from my childhood
    - Her story about how she weathered a storm on the way to france
    - how she is herself a leaf in teh storm of henry the 8th
- Life is full of things we can't control
- I write to feel better about the things I can't control
    - If I can't control them, at least I can understand them
