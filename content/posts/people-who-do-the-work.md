### Scratchpad
- story of lucy and oliver and how oliver got more rewards
- performance based culture pushes the bar beyond "doing the work"
- "There are no gold stars for doing your job"
- Grade inflation

- How do we fix performance based culture? 

- What are we taking for granted that just works?
- How can we actionably help with the problem in our day to day?
